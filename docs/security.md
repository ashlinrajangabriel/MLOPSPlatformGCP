# Security Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the security features implemented in the Developer Platform.

## Overview

The Developer Platform implements a comprehensive security strategy that includes:
- Network isolation with VPC Service Controls
- Container security and vulnerability scanning
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Audit logging and compliance
- Cost controls and resource management
- Security monitoring and alerting

## VPC Service Controls

### Purpose
VPC Service Controls create a security perimeter around Google Cloud resources to prevent data exfiltration and unauthorized access.

### Implementation
```hcl
# Access Policy
resource "google_access_context_manager_access_policy" "default" {
  parent = "organizations/${var.org_id}"
  title  = "Organization Access Policy"
}

# Access Level
resource "google_access_context_manager_access_level" "developer_platform_access" {
  parent = google_access_context_manager_access_policy.default.name
  name   = "accessPolicies/${google_access_context_manager_access_policy.default.name}/accessLevels/developer_platform_access"
  title  = "developer_platform_access"
  basic {
    conditions {
      ip_subnetworks = var.authorized_ip_ranges
      members = ["user:${var.admin_email}"]
      regions = ["BE", "FR", "US"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration
1. Define authorized IP ranges in `terraform.tfvars`:
   ```hcl
   authorized_ip_ranges = [
     "10.0.0.0/8",
     "172.16.0.0/12",
     "192.168.0.0/16"
   ]
   ```

2. Configure service perimeter in `main.tf`

## Container Security

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Automated scanning of container images
- Integration with Container Analysis API
- Real-time vulnerability detection
- Customizable security policies

### Binary Authorization
- Enforces deployment policies
- Validates container signatures
- Prevents unauthorized deployments
- Maintains deployment audit trail

## Identity and Access Management

### Custom IAM Roles
```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_custom_role" "developer" {
  role_id     = "developerRestricted"
  title       = "Developer Restricted Role"
  permissions = [
    "bigquery.datasets.get",
    "bigquery.jobs.create",
    "bigquery.tables.get",
    "storage.objects.get"
  ]
}
```

### Best Practices
1. Follow principle of least privilege
2. Regular access reviews
3. Service account key rotation
4. Automated permission management

## Audit Logging

### Configuration
```hcl
resource "google_logging_project_sink" "enhanced_audit" {
  name        = "enhanced-audit-logs"
  destination = "storage.googleapis.com/${var.audit_bucket}/enhanced-audit"
  filter      = <<EOT
    resource.type=("gce_instance" OR "k8s_container")
    OR
    protoPayload.methodName=("SetIamPolicy")
    OR
    severity >= WARNING
  EOT
}
```

### Log Types
1. Admin Activity logs
2. Data Access logs
3. System Event logs
4. Policy Denied logs

## Cost Controls

### Budget Alerts
```hcl
resource "google_billing_budget" "project_budget" {
  billing_account = var.billing_account_id
  display_name    = "${var.environment}-budget"

  budget_filter {
    projects = ["projects/${var.project_id}"]
  }

  amount {
    specified_amount {
      currency_code = "USD"
      units        = var.monthly_budget_amount
    }
  }

  threshold_rules {
    threshold_percent = 0.8
  }
}
```

### Cost Allocation
- Resource tagging strategy
- Department/team allocation
- Project-based tracking
- Usage monitoring

## Security Monitoring

### Alert Policies
```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "security_events" {
  display_name = "Security Events Alert"
  conditions {
    display_name = "Critical Security Events"
    condition_threshold {
      filter = "resource.type = \"audited_resource\" AND severity >= ERROR"
    }
  }
}
```

### Notification Channels
- Email notifications
- Slack integration
- PagerDuty integration
- Custom webhooks

## Compliance

### Audit Trail
- All changes logged
- 365-day retention
- Immutable audit logs
- Regular compliance reports

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- TLS encryption in transit
- Regular backups
- Data residency controls

## Security Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance
1. Rotate service account keys every 90 days
2. Review IAM permissions monthly
3. Update container images weekly
4. Monitor security logs daily

### Incident Response
1. Automated alerting
2. Defined response procedures
3. Regular security drills
4. Documentation updates

### Access Reviews
1. Quarterly IAM audits
2. Service account review
3. Resource permission check
4. Network access validation
